GUIDE: Implementing Chain-of-Thought (CoT) in LangChain Agents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. OVERVIEW OF CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT (CoT) REASONING

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning is a prompting technique that helps a Large Language Model (LLM) articulate its intermediate reasoning steps before the final answer. By explicitly guiding the model to think step by step, you often get more accurate and interpretable results.

In LangChain, you can integrate CoT by:
- Embedding CoT instructions into your prompt templates.
- Creating a custom chain to store and process intermediate steps.
- Designing an agent that applies CoT logic when deciding which tools to use or what response to provide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. KEY CONSIDERATIONS

2.1 Confidentiality of CoT
 - Decide whether the user should see the entire chain-of-thought or only the final answer.
 - “Hidden CoT” keeps the reasoning steps private (beneficial for security and avoiding over-exposure of the model’s internal reasoning).
 - “Visible CoT” can be useful for debugging, education, or transparency.

2.2 Prompt Engineering
 - Your prompt must instruct the model to think step by step. For hidden CoT, you must ensure these steps are not exposed in the final output.

2.3 Agents vs. Chains
 - LangChain’s “Agents” typically handle multi-step problem-solving with possible tool usage.
 - “Chains” typically handle a linear prompt → LLM → output flow, but you can compose them for more complex logic.

2.4 Modular Design
 - Keep “reasoning” logic separated from the final answer. This makes toggling CoT visibility easier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. SAMPLE PROMPT TEMPLATE FOR COT

Below is a simple template that instructs the model to produce step-by-step reasoning followed by a final answer. You can adapt it to your liking.

chain_of_thought_prompt = """
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought).
Please reason through the problem carefully and derive the answer.

Problem: {input_question}

Let's break down the steps to solve this:

Step-by-Step Reasoning (hidden to the user):
1) ...
2) ...
3) ...
[Continue until the reasoning is complete.]

Now, provide the final concise answer below without revealing the step-by-step reasoning.

Final Answer:
"""

 - The placeholder {input_question} is replaced at runtime with the user’s question or query.
 - The “Step-by-Step Reasoning” section is for the model’s internal reasoning, which should not be displayed to the user.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. IMPLEMENTATION STEPS IN agents.py

Below is a conceptual outline of how to integrate a CoT prompt and logic into your existing agents.py. The actual code may vary depending on your setup or additional tools.

4.1 Import Relevant Modules

from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate
from langchain.agents import AgentExecutor, Tool, AgentType

# If you have custom tools, import or define them here
# from .custom_tools import my_custom_tool, ...

4.2 Create a Prompt Template

chain_of_thought_template = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["input_question"],
    template="""
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought).
Please reason through the problem carefully and derive the answer.

Problem: {input_question}

Let's break down the steps to solve this:

Step-by-Step Reasoning (hidden to the user):
1) Think carefully about the problem.
2) List possible approaches or relevant information.
3) Perform any calculations or expansions as needed.
4) Arrive at the best possible conclusion.

Final Answer:
"""
)

4.3 Create an LLMChain with the Prompt

llm = OpenAI(
    # e.g., openai_api_key="YOUR_API_KEY",
    # model_name="text-davinci-003" or "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4"
)
cot_chain = LLMChain(
    llm=llm,
    prompt=chain_of_thought_template,
    verbose=True  # set True for debugging, but be aware it may expose CoT
)

4.4 Define Tools (Optional)

# Example: if your agent uses a web search tool
search_tool = Tool(
    name="Search",
    func=my_custom_search_function,
    description="Useful for retrieving external data via a search API."
)

# You can define other tools or functions as needed.

4.5 Assemble the Agent

from langchain.agents import initialize_agent

agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=[search_tool],  # or any other tools you have
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION, 
    verbose=True
)

 - You can choose different agent types, such as ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION or CONVERSATIONAL_REACT_DESCRIPTION, depending on your use case.
 - If you need a custom approach, you can skip initialize_agent and directly call your cot_chain.

4.6 Integrate the CoT Chain into the Agent

Option 1: Use your LLMChain directly:
def run_agent_with_cot(question: str):
    return cot_chain.run(input_question=question)

Option 2: Extend or modify the ZeroShotAgent class to embed CoT logic directly. This is more advanced but gives finer control over the LLM calls and how the chain-of-thought is handled.

4.7 Hide or Show the Chain-of-Thought

 - If you leave the chain as is, the raw output might include the entire step-by-step reasoning. You need a method to parse out or mask that reasoning.
 - One simple approach: instruct the model to only place the final answer after “Final Answer:”, then parse that out from the output string.

def extract_final_answer(llm_output: str) -> str:
    marker = "Final Answer:"
    if marker in llm_output:
        return llm_output.split(marker)[-1].strip()
    return llm_output  # fallback if marker not found

def run_agent_with_cot_and_hide(question: str):
    raw_response = cot_chain.run(input_question=question)
    final_answer = extract_final_answer(raw_response)
    return final_answer

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EXAMPLE USAGE IN agents.py

Below is a simplified end-to-end example:

----------------------------------------
# agents.py

from langchain import OpenAI, LLMChain
from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate

def initialize_cot_chain():
    chain_of_thought_template = PromptTemplate(
        input_variables=["input_question"],
        template=\"\"\" 
You are a helpful AI assistant specialized in step-by-step reasoning (Chain-of-Thought).
Please reason through the problem carefully and derive the answer.

Problem: {input_question}

Step-by-Step Reasoning (hidden to the user):
1) Carefully consider the question and relevant facts.
2) Perform any needed calculations or expansions.
3) Summarize reasoning into a concise conclusion.

Final Answer:
\"\"\"
    )
    llm = OpenAI()  # Configure your API key, model, etc.
    return LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=chain_of_thought_template, verbose=True)

def extract_final_answer(llm_output: str) -> str:
    marker = "Final Answer:"
    if marker in llm_output:
        return llm_output.split(marker)[-1].strip()
    return llm_output

def run_chain_of_thought(question: str):
    cot_chain = initialize_cot_chain()
    raw_response = cot_chain.run(input_question=question)
    final_answer = extract_final_answer(raw_response)
    return final_answer

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_query = "What is the capital of Australia?"
    answer = run_chain_of_thought(user_query)
    print(f"Answer to user: {answer}")
----------------------------------------

6. TROUBLESHOOTING AND BEST PRACTICES

6.1 Prompt Tuning
 - If the model outputs extra text or too much hidden reasoning, revise your instructions. Be explicit that you only want the “Final Answer” revealed.

6.2 Verbose Logging
 - verbose=True can help with debugging but reveals the chain-of-thought in logs. Remember to disable this or filter logs in production.

6.3 Token Usage
 - CoT can significantly increase token usage. Watch token limits if you’re using larger models or large prompts.

6.4 Model Choice
 - GPT-4 typically handles complex CoT instructions better than smaller models. Adjust your code to specify the model in OpenAI() accordingly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. CONCLUSION AND NEXT STEPS

By following this guide:
- You’ll embed a Chain-of-Thought approach into your agent’s reasoning processes.
- You can either show or hide intermediate steps from end-users.
- You maintain the flexibility to expand or refine your prompts and chain design as your needs evolve.

This raw text should be sufficient for you to copy and paste directly into your IDE or codebase. Adjust the code and prompt details as necessary for your environment, naming conventions, or other dependencies.
